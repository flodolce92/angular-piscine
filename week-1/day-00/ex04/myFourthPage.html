          Star Trek è un media franchise di genere fantascientifico che ha avuto
          inizio nel 1966 con una serie televisiva omonima ideata da Gene
          Roddenberry, divenuta in seguito tra le più popolari nella storia
          della televisione. Dal successo della prima serie sono derivate nel
          corso di oltre cinquant'anni altre dieci serie televisive (di cui tre
          animate) e tredici pellicole cinematografiche. Una nuova serie
          televisiva ha debuttato nel 2017 e un'altra nel 2020. Star Trek narra
          delle vicende degli umani del futuro, appartenenti a una Federazione
          dei Pianeti Uniti che riunisce sotto un unico governo numerosi popoli
          di sistemi stellari diversi e delle loro avventure nell'esplorazione
          del cosmo "alla ricerca di nuove forme di vita e di civiltà, fino ad
          arrivare là dove nessun uomo è mai giunto prima". L'universo
          fantascientifico di Star Trek con i suoi personaggi è conosciuto in
          tutto il mondo e ha dato origine a una comunità di appassionati senza
          precedenti. Tutte le serie televisive e i film sono stati doppiati in
          italiano. A Star Trek sono stati assegnati vari premi tra cui 33 Emmy,
          5 premi Hugo, vari Saturn Award e un Premio Oscar su 14 candidature
          ottenute dai film.

          The origin of the Borg is vague. What is known is by hearsay, brief
          contacts with Borg survivors, and even the Borg itself. The Borg
          originated in the Delta Quadrant. According to the Borg Queen, the
          species known as the Borg started out as normal plain lifeforms; they
          had been developing for thousands of centuries before the 24th
          century, and over many years, they evolved into a mixture of organic
          and artificial life with cybernetic enhancements. By 1484, the Borg
          had assimilated only a handful of star systems of the Quadrant and
          they had many encounters with the Vaadwaur but by 2373, the Borg had
          assimilated thousands of systems. Their territory was intersected by a
          narrow corridor of space filled with gravimetric distortions,
          eventually nicknamed the "Northwest Passage" by the crew of the
          Federation starship USS Voyager during the Borg's conflict with
          Species 8472. The farthest border of the Borg realm within the Delta
          Quadrant seemed to be the Nekrit Expanse. The Collective had their own
          territory and ventured out, beyond it, on exploration missions. At one
          time, Voyager was thrown 9,500 light years, beyond Borg territory and
          ten years closer to Earth. Over the next four years, the starship
          still encountered Borg vessels. Since the Borg had such extensive
          transwarp networks throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, they could
          effectively project their presence anywhere in a comparatively short
          amount of time. While the Borg did have a large expanse of their own
          territory, it was finite, and any forays elsewhere were simply
          invasions of other territories. Within the Delta Quadrant, the Borg
          had a vast structure called the Unicomplex. This structure was made up
          of thousands of sub-structures and housed many of their vessels. It
          was believed the Unicomplex was the Borg headquarters. When the Borg
          started using transwarp hubs, they could appear anywhere in the
          galaxy, giving them the ability to assimilate species with little or
          no warning at all and within very short periods of time. Their vessels
          were equipped with specially designed conduits to withstand the
          temporal stresses when traveling through transwarp conduits. Borg
          starships had the ability to travel through time. They once tried to
          assimilate a species by traveling back in time.

          Star Trek: The Next Generation, often abbreviated to TNG, is the
          second live-action Star Trek television series, and the first set in
          the 24th century. Like its predecessors, it was created by Gene
          Roddenberry. Produced at Paramount Pictures, it aired in first-run
          syndication, by Paramount Television in the US, from September 1987 to
          May 1994. The series was set in the 24th century and featured the
          voyages of the starship USS Enterprise-D under Captain Jean-Luc
          Picard. The series led to four spin-offs set in the same time period:
          Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which it ran alongside during its final
          two seasons, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Lower Decks and Star Trek:
          Picard. It is also the beginning of a contiguous period of time during
          which there was always at least one Star Trek series in production,
          ending with Star Trek: Enterprise in 2005.
